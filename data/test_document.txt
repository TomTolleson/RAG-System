This is a test document about Milvus. Milvus is a highly scalable vector database built for AI applications.
Milvus provides CRUD operations, scalar filtering, and supports both CPU and GPU implementations. It has a cloud-native architecture and integrates well with modern ML/AI workflows.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science that focuses on creating intelligent machines capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence. These tasks include learning, reasoning, problem-solving, understanding natural language, and perception.

Key Components of AI:
1. Machine Learning: Systems that can learn from data and improve their performance over time.
2. Natural Language Processing: The ability to understand and generate human language.
3. Computer Vision: The ability to interpret and understand visual information.
4. Robotics: The integration of AI with physical machines.

Applications of AI:
- Healthcare: Diagnosis, treatment planning, and drug discovery
- Finance: Fraud detection, algorithmic trading, and risk assessment
- Transportation: Self-driving cars and traffic management
- Education: Personalized learning and automated grading
- Customer Service: Chatbots and virtual assistants

Ethical Considerations:
- Privacy concerns
- Job displacement
- Bias in AI systems
- Decision-making transparency
- Accountability for AI actions
