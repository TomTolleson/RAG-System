# How to Find the "Run workflow" Button

## 🎯 Exact Steps (with Screenshots)

Based on what you're seeing, here's exactly where to click:

### Step 1: You're currently here (Correct!)
```
Actions Tab
├─ .github/workflows/status-check.yml  ← You're viewing this
└─ [Workflow runs list showing #4, #3, #2, #1]
```

### Step 2: Look ABOVE the workflow runs list

The "Run workflow" button appears **AT THE TOP** of the page, in the **RIGHT CORNER**, above where it says "Filter workflow runs".

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Repository Status Check          [Run workflow ▼]  ← HERE!
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  Filter workflow runs                                   │
│  status-check.yml                                       │
│                                                          │
│  4 workflow runs                                        │
│  #4: Add documentation...                               │
│  #3: Fix JSON parsing...                               │
│  ...                                                     │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Step 3: If you still don't see it

The button might be collapsed. Try:

1. **Make your browser window wider** - the button might be off-screen
2. **Scroll to the very top** of the page - look above "Filter workflow runs"
3. **Right-click and "View Page Source"** - search for "Run workflow" to confirm it exists

## ✅ Verified: Your Workflow is Configured Correctly

I can see run #2 says "Manually run by TomTolleson" - this proves:
- ✅ `workflow_dispatch` is working
- ✅ You have permissions
- ✅ The button WAS visible before

## 🔄 Alternative: Use GitHub CLI

If you can't find the button, you can trigger it from command line:

```bash
# Install GitHub CLI (if not installed)
# Mac: brew install gh
# Then authenticate: gh auth login

# Trigger the workflow
gh workflow run "Repository Status Check"
```

## 🔗 Direct Link (Try This)

Click this exact link:
https://github.com/TomTolleson/RAG-System/actions/workflows/status-check.yml

Then look at the **very top right** of that page - above the runs list.

## 📱 Mobile/Tablet Users

If you're on mobile, the button might be hidden or require:
- Rotating to landscape mode
- Using desktop view in your browser settings

## 🐛 Still Can't See It?

If you genuinely cannot see the button anywhere, it might be a GitHub UI bug. In that case:

1. **Report to GitHub** - This shouldn't happen
2. **Use the CLI** (command above)
3. **Just wait** - The workflow runs automatically daily at 9 AM UTC anyway

---

**Remember:** The workflow runs automatically every day, so even if you can't trigger it manually, it's still working!
